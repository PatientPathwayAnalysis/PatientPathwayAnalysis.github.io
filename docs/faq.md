### Q: What is the value of the IPPA?
**A:** The IPPA provides a platform linking the information from data and clinical practices. It summarises complicate healthcare records into a manageable size. 

### Q: Why is the knowing patient pathways important for patients? 
**A:** Knowing the story behind patient pathways, we can understand 

- What stage makes patients struggling   
- Which aspects we can improve for patients


### Q: Why is the knowing patient pathways important for healthcare providers? 
**A:** Knowing the story behind patient pathways, we can understand

- If the current resource allocations enable proper healthcare for dealing with the disease
- If the diagnostic procedure is efficient to find the patients and treat them

 can profile the efficacy of health system dealing with a specific disease or health condition. 


### Q: Is the IPPA compatible with the covariate analysis? 
**A:**  Yes. The IPPA can degrade complicate healthcare series to patient pathways, and many statistics can be read directly from the pathways. You can freely link those statistics with whatever statistical models of interest. For example, the interval between the initial care-seeking and disease confirmation is system delay, the health status at the end of a pathway is treatment outcome.
